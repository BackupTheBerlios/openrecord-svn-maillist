<PRE>Hi Brian,

After our meeting today, I thought a little more about how to make  
outline view and table view one in the same thing such that users can  
start out by creating data in an outline (which is an extremely  
intuitive way to go about structuring data) without regretting it  
afterwards.

Katie, I've cc:d you because you were the one who brought this to my  
attention.

Omni-outlineralso conflates an outline view with a table...however as  
we discussed, it runs into a few problems:

1. If you try to sort by a column (ie. status = Done), because items  
are organized in a hierarchical tree, the user can never really see  
all of their Done items clumped together because Omni-Outliner  
refuses to break the tree. So the best you can do is sort by the top  
node, which wouldn't get you very far.

Dinner party (Now)
     Albertson's (Now)
         Fontina (Now)
         Sparkling apple juice (Later)
         Scallions (Now)
         Marjoram (Now)
         Swordfish (Now)
         Lime (Now)
         Wine (Later)
     Order flowers (Done)
     Wash napkins (Done)
     Look up Jamie's allergies (Now)

Restock spices (Later)
     Marjoram (Now)
     Cinnamon (Later)
     Nutmeg (Later)

2. Omni-outliner also doesn't understand about a single item living  
in multiple places (ie. Marjoram lives in both Dinner  
party&gt;&gt;Albertson's AND Restock spices.

Proposal: What if...You could sort for real thereby flattening out  
the hierarchy. However, from any item in the list, you can open up  
the thread or hierarchy that the item belongs to.

Step 1: I've sorted the hierarchical tree above by status, therby  
flattening the tree into a plain list.

Dinner party (Now)
Albertson's (Now)
Fontina (Now)
Scallions (Now)
+ Marjoram (Now)
Swordfish (Now)
Lime (Now)
Look up Jamie's allergies (Now)
Sparkling apple juice (Later)
Wine (Later)
Restock spices (Later)
Cinnamon (Later)
Nutmeg (Later)
Order flowers (Done)
Wash napkins (Done)



Step 2: I've opened the item Marjoram so I can see its hierarchical  
context.

Dinner party (Now)
Albertson's (Now)
Fontina (Now)
Scallions (Now)

Dinner party (Now)
     Albertson's (Now)
         Fontina (Now)
         Sparkling apple juice (Later)
         Scallions (Now)
       - Marjoram (Now)
         Swordfish (Now)
         Lime (Now)
         Wine (Later)
     Order flowers (Done)
     Wash napkins (Done)
     Look up Jamie's allergies (Now)

Swordfish (Now)
Lime (Now)
Look up Jamie's allergies (Now)
Sparkling apple juice (Later)
Wine (Later)
Restock spices (Later)
Cinnamon (Later)
Nutmeg (Later)
Order flowers (Done)
Wash napkins (Done)


Step 3: The item Marjoram actually belongs to more than 1 tree. Here,  
I've chosen to view it in the context of the Dinner party tree.

Dinner party (Now)
Albertson's (Now)
Fontina (Now)
Scallions (Now)

Restock spices (Later)
   - Marjoram (Now)
     Cinnamon (Later)
     Nutmeg (Later

Swordfish (Now)
Lime (Now)
Look up Jamie's allergies (Now)
Sparkling apple juice (Later)
Wine (Later)
Restock spices (Later)
Cinnamon (Later)
Nutmeg (Later)
Order flowers (Done)
Wash napkins (Done)

This is sort of like clusters in Chandler, the only tweak is that  
these would be hierarchical clusters.
